# Explorers - an Educational App

This was our third project and our first group project. It was to be built in vanilla JavaScript, using an API, without frameworks. 

It was made over the course of one week, with three group members.

## Brief

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way.

Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts. The topic of the app is your choice, but here are some suggestions you could look into:

- Interactive timeline, e.g. of the history of computer programming
- Interactive map of a historical event - e.g. World War 1, the travels of Christopher Columbus

## MVP

Display some information about a particular topic in an interesting way
Have some user interactivity using event listeners, e.g to move through different sections of content
